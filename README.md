# Example Project: Machine Replacement Model

Example project for solving Operations Research machine maintenance/replacement models. This app was a sample created in pure JS and Bootstrap.

## Notes

- This tool/example-project was superseded by [2DP Repsymo Solver](https://github.com/TobiasBriones/2dp-repsymo-solver)
  which is a complete web application that solves several models of dynamic programming.
  
- In the solutions tree you have a pair (K, R) that indicates an imaginary arrow if you take either Keep (**K**) or 
  Replace (**R**) from that node, e.g. in the screenshot example if you are in the decision year #2 and your machine has 4 years, if you choose **K** then the arrow goes from that node to the node with the value of 5 in the next decision year, if you choose **R** then the arrow goes to the node with the value of 1 in the next decision year.
