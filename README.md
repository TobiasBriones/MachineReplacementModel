Example project for solving Operations Research machine maintenance/replacement models. This app was
a sample created in pure JS and Bootstrap.

## Notes

- This tool/example-project was superseded
  by [2DP Repsymo Solver](https://github.com/TobiasBriones/2dp-repsymo-solver)
  which is a complete web application that solves several models of dynamic programming.

- In the solutions tree you have a pair (K, R) that indicates an imaginary arrow if you take either
  Keep (**K**) or Replace (**R**) from that node, e.g. in the screenshot example if you are in the
  decision year #2 and your machine has 4 years, if you choose **K** then the arrow goes from that
  node to the node with the value of 5 in the next decision year, if you choose **R** then the arrow
  goes to the node with the value of 1 in the next decision year.

- More unit tests can be added to the source code, I only tested the machine-replacement module.

- In the solutions tree, the last decision year on the abscissa does not appear because I considered
  it was not necessary to plot it for this project.

- By default, the example found in Taha's book from the machine replacement section comes set with
  this app. Moreover, you might find that the example in the book has an error in the decision for
  the stage 3 with t = 5!

- The [samples module](./src/js/machine-replacement-samples.mjs) also has an example from this
  source: [AARF sample](https://www.mbsresearch.com/files/journals/2017/July/_current_2017_Aug_BIJuMqzmjVgbate.pdf).
  The default sample to show in the app can be set in the MainPage constructor. The default sample
  is Taha's example, so you can opt to set the AARF one to check it out too.

- I've checked several samples from papers, and it's incredible how wrong they are and how much time
  those mistakes take away from us the readers. I've found horrible mistakes related to:
  copy-paste, numeric computation (all the values from the beginning), and minor mistakes like
  printing a wrong character in the best of the cases. So, it's quite easy to spot those huge or
  minor mistakes by using the application to compute the right solutions.

## Getting started

Run [index.html](./src/index.html) on an HTTP server to serve the app.

Run [index.test.html](./src/index.test.html) on an HTTP server to execute the tests.
